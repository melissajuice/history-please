# *LEARN WHY GORD DOWNIE IS A CANADIAN HERO!!!!*
### *The man, his band and his legacy*
Gordon Downie (known widely as Gord Downie) grew up in a suburb of Kingston, Ontario, where he befriended the musicians who would become The Tragically Hip while attending the downtown Kingston high school Kingston Collegiate and Vocational Institute. Downie has collaborated with fellow Canadian and international artists. His most famous Canadian collaborations are with Richard Terfry (better known as Buck 65), Dallas Green of City and Colour and Alexisonfire, the Sadies and Fucked Up. These collaborations do not include the musicians who have helped Downie to create his solo albums. Downie is heavily involved in environmental movements, especially issues concerning water rights. He is board member of Lake Ontario Waterkeeper.With Lake Ontario Waterkeeper, Downie helped work on a cause to prevent a cement company from burning tires for fuel. The Tragically Hip announced on their website on 24 May 2016 that Downie had been diagnosed with a terminal brain tumour. Doctors at Toronto's Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre confirmed the same day that it is a glioblastoma, which has responded favourably to radiation and chemotherapy treatment but is not curable. Secret Path is the fifth studio album by Gord Downie, released on October 18, 2016. The album was accompanied by a graphic novel of the same name, written by Downie and illustrated by Jeff Lemire, as well as an animated television film to air on CBC Television on October 23.

The project is a concept album about Chanie Wenjack, a young Anishinaabe boy from the Marten Falls First Nation who died in 1966 while trying to return home after escaping from an Indian residential school. All proceeds from the album and book are being donated to the University of Manitoba's National Centre for Truth and Reconciliation project.
